* PODIUM
** Introduction
   *Podium* is an *E-Reader* application for *Music Scores*. It is currently under active development.\\

   - [[https://www.studiop5.org/podium.html][/Click here to launch Podium in your browser/]]

   Highlights:
   - 100% browser-based:
      - completely free, entirely open source, and totally unsupported
      - no installion, no registration, no login, no file import.  Just use it!
      - built for Google Chrome, but runs (mostly) on any modern desktop/tablet/smartphone browser
   - Experimental UI built around collapsable circular menu
   - An alternative to generic PDF viewers, customized for the layout and annotation of scores in PDF format
      - not a music library: works with PDF files stored locally or on Google Drive
      - uses PDF /annotations/ and /embedded document metadata/ to store user edits
   - Works with:
     - touch screens
     - styluses: S-Pen, Apple Pencil, USI, ...
     - mouse and keyboard
   - Multiple layout schemes
     - book :: simulated physical book with animated page flips
     - scrolling :: vertical or horizontal, displaying a settable number of pages
     - table :: thumbnails of all pages (potentially overlapping), viewable at once
   - Annotation tools
     - freehand line drawing tool
     - text annotation tool
     - [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rastrum][rastrum]] tool for drawing staff lines
     - symbol tool, exposing all music glyphs from the included [[https://www.smufl.org/][SMuFL]]-compliant *Bravura* music font
   - Tools for practice sessions
     - metronome, including an animated conducting hand
     - on-screen piano keyboard, with functions for assisted tuning<
     - visualizer tool that continuously records the last 2 minutes (configurable) of
        a practice session, both audio and video, for instant playback
     - stopwatch and clock
** Quick Start
*** TODO write the quick start guide
** Menu
   When Podium is launched, it will display a gray screen with a circular menu:\\
   [[./img/menu.png]] 


   This menu serves the same purpose as the menus of other interfaces. Its buttons, called /cells/, invoke
   all the functionality of the app.


   There are three parts to this menu.
   1. grip :: The inner circle of the menu
      - *drag* the grip to move the menu anywhere on screen
        - the grip is painted to suggest a sandpaper-like texture. Whenever this texture appears in the app,
          dragging it will reposition its corresponding widget.
        - the grip can be dragged to any edge of the screen, but will always be partially visible
      - *tap* the grip to expand <-> collapse the menu
        - collapse the menu to save screen space
      - *long press* the /grip/ to *park* the menu in the upper-left corner of the screen

*** TODO check out parking behaviour of expanded vs collapsed menu
