* Introduction
   *Podium* is an /E-Reader/ application for /Music Scores/. It is currently under active development,
    but ready for beta-testing.\\

   Highlights:
   - 100% browser-based:
      - completely free, entirely open source, and totally unsupported
      - no installion, no registration, no login, no file import.  Just use it!
      - built for Google Chrome, but runs (mostly) on any modern desktop/tablet/smartphone browser
   - Experimental UI built around collapsable circular menu
   - An alternative to generic PDF viewers, customized for the layout and annotation of scores in PDF format
      - not a music library: works with PDF files stored /locally/ or in the clound. Currently, /Google Drive/
        is the only cloud provider supported (sigh).
      - uses PDF /annotations/ and /embedded document metadata/ to store user edits
   - Works on:
     - non touch screens, using mouse and keyboard
     - touch screens, using:
       - S-Pen
       - Apple Pencil
       - USI styluses
       - your fingers!
   - Multiple layout schemes:
     - book :: simulated physical book with animated page flips
     - scrolling :: vertical or horizontal, displaying a settable number of pages
     - table :: thumbnails of all pages (potentially overlapping), viewable at once
   - Annotation tools
     - freehand line drawing tool
     - text annotation tool
     - [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rastrum][rastrum]] tool for drawing staff lines
     - symbol tool, exposing all music glyphs from the included [[https://www.smufl.org/][SMuFL]]-compliant *Bravura* music font
   - Tools for practice sessions
     - metronome, including an animated conducting hand
     - on-screen piano keyboard, with functions for assisted tuning
     - visualizer tool that continuously records the last 2 minutes (configurable) of
        a practice session, both audio and video, for instant playback
     - stopwatch and clock

* Quick Start
    An intuitive way to get started is to launch Podium in your browser, then start playing with it. Refer
    back to this manual when things get confusing.

* Menu
   When Podium is launched, it displays a gray screen with a circular menu:
#+CAPTION: Podium's circular menu
#+NAME:  fig:menu
#+ATTR_HTML: :width 800px
   [[./assets/menu.png]] 

   The menu serves a similar purpose to menus of other computer interfaces. It organizes a set of buttons,
   called /cells/, that provide access to the app's functionality.

   There are three parts to the menu:
   1. *Grip*: The inner circle of the menu
      - /drag/ on the grip to move the menu anywhere on screen
        - The grip is painted to suggest a sandpaper-like texture. Whenever this texture appears in the app,
          dragging it will reposition its corresponding widget.
        - While the grip can be dragged anywhere on screen, it cannot be dragged completely offscreen. It will always be
          partially visible.
      - /tap/ the grip to expand or collapse the menu
        - Collapsing the menu saves screen space. Tap it again to expand the menu.
      - /long press/ the grip to /park/ the menu in the upper-left corner of the screen
        - Parking the menu is a convenience for quickly getting it out of the way when not needed.
   2. <<disk>> *Disk*: the circular area consisting of 6 cells that surrounds the grip
      - /tap/ on any disk cell (except /Screen/) to change which cells are available in the [[ring][ring]]
        - The /Screen/ disk cell is unique. It does not have a corresponding ring: rather, it immediately toggles
         full-screen display on/off.
   3. <<ring>> *Ring*: the outer ring of cells
      - There are actually 5 rings, but only one is available at a time, as determined by the currenly active [[disk][disk]] cell.
        1. <<score-ring>> *Score*: contains cells for working with entire scores: opening a score, or creating a new,
           empty score. Once opened, the score can be saved, printed, or closed.
        2. <<layout-ring>> *Layout*: contains cells that customize the /layout/ of the the currently opened score.
        3. <<pages-ring>> *Pages*: contains cells for adding, deleting, or duplicating the score's pages,  and for customizing
           how the score's page numbers are displayed.
        4. <<ink-ring>> *Ink*: contains cells for annotating the active score's active page.
        5. <<move-ring>> *More*: contains cells that invoke app functionality not directly related to a score.

   A cell can be in one of three states:
   1. Disabled: the cell's icon and text are displayed in a light grey color, showing that the cell's function is
      not available in the current context. For example, in Figure [[fig:menu]], the /Close/, /Save/, and /Print/ disk cells
      are disabled, as there is no open score for them to work on. Tapping a disabled cell will do nothing.
   2. Enabled: the cell's icon and text are displayed in black, showing that the the cell's function is available by
      /tapping/ (or, in some cases, /long pressing/) the cell.
      - /long pressing/ on most cells launches a panel that customizes the cell's functionality.
        - For some cells, there is no further functionality to customize. For such cells, a /long press/ is
          equivalent to a /tap/.
** TODO add logic to know when a score is edited, use this to toggle save
** TODO add logic to warn when an unsaved edited score is closed
** TODO implement the "freeze annotations" functionality
** TODO implement print functionality
** BUG when you resize a line, lock x and y so they can't be scaled independently
